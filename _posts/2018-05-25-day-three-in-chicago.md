After a late night the day before, we decided to sleep in.  In the morning we
watched [Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) and Scott made
delicious omelettes with the ingredients we had bought a few days before.

We walked to Southport train station and took a train into the city.

Our first destination was the [Cloud
Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) ("the bean").

![Bean Panorama]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0529.jpg' %})

![Yet another bean angle]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2463.jpg' %})

The bean reflected the buidlings around it.  It was also really cool to see the
sky reflected in the bean.

![Bean and the sky]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0537.jpg' %})

You can walk under the bean.  Its quite cool to look upwards when directly
under it!

Kenny asked someone for our photo with the bean.

![Group and the Bean Attempt 1]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2475.jpg' %})

However, he was not very pleased that the photo did not include the entire
bean.  So, we walked around to the other side of the bean (to avoid our
previous photographer).  Kenny asked a couple if they'd like a photo.  As he
took it he said, "I will try to get the entire bean in the shot."  After he
took the photo he asked if they would take one of us (very sly of him to hint
at instructions like this).

After that, we walked around a bit, trying to recreate the photo that Paul and
Britta used on their wedding invitation.  We knew we were in the right general
area based on the buildings in the background of the photo.  First, we
walked on a bridge that goes over [Millenium
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Park) (park that contains the
bean), thinking it might give us a good overall view of the park and help us
find the spot.

![Bridge over the park]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0538.jpg' %})

Bach had an injured leg, so he was often last as we walked.

![Bach is last]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2480.jpg' %})

Turns out that bridge went nowhere, so, we headed backwards on the bridge.

![Kenny takes a selfie as we walk back]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2487.jpg' %})

We ended up back near [Jay Pritzker
Pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Pritzker_Pavilion).

![George infront of Jay Pritzker Pavilion]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0542.jpg' %})

There was also a nice garden nearby.

To keep Bach walking earlier, we had promised to visit the [Nutella
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/nutella-cafe-chicago-3).  Most of us ordered
fruit and Nutella crepes while there.  Mine had strawberries in it.

![Strawberry and Nutella Crepe]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0554.jpg' %})

Right next door was [Stan's
Donuts](https://www.yelp.com/biz/stans-donuts-and-coffee-chicago-16).  So, we
sheepishly walked 1 business over to enter another dessert store (yes, we bought
another snack).

![Stan's]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0549.jpg' %})

The ceiling in the store was covered in donuts!

![Stan's Ceiling]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0556.jpg' %})

They had about 8 cold brews on tap.  Bach, Ramya, and I ordered frappes
instead, however, and found them extremely sweet - so sweet that we couldn't
drink very much of them.

We took our drinks to go and wandered north towards the Riverwalk, hoping to
find bikes.  All around this area you can see [Trump
Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)).
It's not a bad looking building in my opinion.

![Trump tower]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0558.jpg' %})

Along the Riverwalk I saw a sign for big gears, but no one else was interested
in seeing them.

![Big gears]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0557.jpg' %})

The Riverwalk was very active with people walking and enjoying the sun.

![Scott and Ramya Walking]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0559.jpg' %})

After 10 minutes of walking along the river and no bikes in sight, we went to
a kayak shop and asked the salesperson where the nearest bikes were, and the
man said there weren't any bike rental shops along the river.

Bach was already sitting down at this point (probably too much walking for him)
and the rest of us joined him.  We sat and looked at buildings and wondered how
much rent might be in Chicago.  Turns out it's cheaper than the Bay Area!

![Sitting by the river panorama]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0560.jpg' %})

We could see the end of the river (where it meets [Lake
Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan)) and saw [Navy
Pier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Pier) in the distance.  It looked fun,
so we headed in that direction.

![Navy Pier]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0562.jpg' %})

---

As we approached the pier, we found a bike rental place!  We wanted to ride
with 5 people on a 4-person bike, but the salemans would not let us.  Instead,
he gave us a free single bike during the time that we would be renting the
quad bike.  We took turns on the single person bike - Kenny took the first
shift.

I got the drive the bike!  My friends were not too happy when I started filming
while steering.

We rode past a spot that arched along the lake, which turns out to be the
location where Paul proposed to Britta!

The view was very nice when riding by the lake.

Later it was my turn on the single bike.

![Going over a bump]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0573.jpg' %})

Bach was not pedaling the whole time and got a free ride.  

![Bach relaxing on the bike]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0575.jpg' %})

It was really easy to get ahead of the quad bike.  That thing is very heavy,
especially with the Bach dead weight.

Along the bike ride we saw a hot dog stand.  I went to buy two dogs to share
while the rest had a photo shoot.  The Chicago-style hot dogs were not bad, but
I forgot to take a photo of them.

On our way back we saw [Buckingham
Fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Fountain) (no queen in sight
though).

![Buckingham Fountain]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2556.jpg' %})

One last photo on our bike before we had to give it back.

After the bike ride it was a short (5 minutes or so) walk to Navy Pier.  Once
there we went to find some drinking water, and got some at a McDonald's inside
a food court.  We ended up sitting at a table playing
[Cheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)) for about an hour.  While
playing we snacked on some Chicago popcorn from
[Garrett](https://www.garrettpopcorn.com/).

![Popcorn from Garrett]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0589.jpg' %})

In addition to fair rides (we didn't go on any), there is an indoor garden with
water fountains on the pier.

Dinner was at a Thai restaurant called
[Opart](https://www.yelp.com/biz/opart-thai-house-chicago?osq=opart) and was
quite delicious.  We were all surprised that the restaurant was BYOB and didn't
sell beer.  After eating here we noticed that a lot of places are like this in
Chicago, something we are not used to in the Bay Area.

Unfortunately, I forgot to take a photo of my plate until after I had started
eating.

The next destination was a speakeasy called [The Violet
Hour](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-violet-hour-chicago) and we wanted to look
fresh. So, after dinner we headed back to the Airbnb for an hour to shower and
change.  While there Ramya was asking for a band aid because she hurt her leg
while riding the bike.  We interpreted this as she hurt her butt and wouldn't
let her forget it.

While waiting in line for the bar, a strange shirtless man approached us.  He
was doing "pushups" every 5 minutes or so.  When he approached our group, he
was singing some song he was making up about an "asian man."  It was unclear
whether he was talking to Bach, Kenny, or Scott.

He moved on to interrupt the next group in line instead and sang to someone he
called "the girl with the nice ass."  Once he left we became friends with
everyone in line when we talked about how strange that guy was.

In the bar there are strict house rules.  One of them is no cell phones out, so
we don't have any pictures inside.

We passed the time playing [King's
Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_(game)), but without the playing
cards.  One of us got to be "question master."  We also all rotated names and
if you messed it up you would be forced to drink.

Bach started us off with a riddle game.  He asked "a man is found dead in
water, how did he die?"  After that riddle we did two more - Bach was extremely
into the game.  When the waitress approached to ask if we wanted more drinks,
Bach was quite rude to her and just said "no."  Apparently, he was deep in
thought about the riddle and didn't realize what happened.  Luckily everyone
else in the group apologized to the waitress and she didn't seem to mind.

---

The final stop of the night was [The Wieners
Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wieners_Circle).  

![The Winers Circle]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/kenny/IMG_2618.jpg' %})

The four meat eaters ordered Chicago Dogs.  It seemed like the chocolate
milkshake was a popular order too, but we didn't get one.

![Chicago Dogs]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may25/george/IMG_0594.jpg' %})

Ramya walked across the street to 7-11 and was able to find a band aid.

At home we played more rage cage then watched some more Friends.
