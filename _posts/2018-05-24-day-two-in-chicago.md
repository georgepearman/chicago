We started the morning watching [The
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)), while
waiting for everyone to wake up in the Airbnb.  Ramya was watching the show for
the first time and was at the beginning of season 3.

---

Next, we headed to [Wildberry Pancakes and
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2).  This
breakfast spot is right next to [Cloud
Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) (referred to as "the bean" from
now on), but we didn't see the bean afterwards!

I got a [chilaquiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilaquiles) skillet, which
was pretty tasty.

Kenny got some sort of eggs benedict.

However, neither were as good as this berry french toast.

We ordered way too much food and coundn't finish it.   We got doggie bags and
ended up carrying leftovers around all day.

After breakfast we were burning up in the sun, so we headed north to find
sunscreen.  Along the way we passed a place called [Nutella
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/nutella-cafe-chicago-3).  Bach and Ramya were
craving nutella for the rest of the trip.

We purchased sunscreen at a nearby CVS and continued north to the [Chicago
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River).  We more or less walked
towards [Trump
Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago))
from the breakfast place.

It was a hot sunny day and the water in the Chicago River looked extremely
inviting.  Once we were close to the river, we noticed that we could go down
some stairs and actually walk along the bank.

There were lots of boats out, and everyone on or around the water seemed to be
having a great time.

We decided to do an architecture boat tour of the city.  This was our boat:

![Our boat]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0488.jpg' %})

We asked someone to take our photo while sitting on the boat (we were at the
very front).  A man took our photo, then immediately asked to use some of our
sunscreen - I guess it's a fair exchange.

![Us on the boat]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/ramya/20180524_144932.jpg' %})

We saw many buildings while on the boat (we were on the tour for an hour and
a half).  [150 North
Riverside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/150_North_Riverside) (my favorite) is
wider at the top than at the bottom.

![150 North Riverside]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0489.jpg' %})

You can see how it tapers at the bottom in this side shot (excuse the people in
the front of the photo).

![George and Kenny selfie with building]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0491.jpg' %})

As our boat passed the building we could see our reflection.  The tour guide
mentioned that there is an entire floor (towards the bottom) of this building
filled with water, that helps the building not fall over when the wind blows.

![Reflection of boat in 150 North Riverside]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0497.jpg' %})

We rode the boat through many bridges.  The entire river is covered with
streets that cross from one side to another.  Our tour boat is small enough to
go under all the bridges.  However, the bridges are able to split and raise to
allow larger boats to pass through.  It causes very bad car traffic, so the
city tries to avoid raising the bridges whenever possible.

There was one bridge that is permanently raised.  In this photo you can see the
huge piece of concrete used to offset the weight of the bridge.

![Raise bridge with concrete]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0493.jpg' %})

We also saw a train crossing the river quite frequently.  I think this might
have been the "brown line," which we rode the next day.

![Train crossing the river]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0502.jpg' %})

I also found this building interesting.  Kenny says it looks just like
a corn-on-the-cob.

After our boat ride we walked towards a rooftop lounge called
[Cindy's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cindys-chicago), taking a scenic route along
the river for a little bit.  Along the way we saw a [Vietnam Veterans
Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_(Chicago)).

The view was amazing at Cindy's, but it looked even better with a Friesling in
the shot!

Scott and I were very confused with a lady we saw because it looked like she
was wearing her shirt backwards.  Turns out it's just a new style trend where
the buttons were put on the wrong side of the shirt.

Towards the end of the night Ramya moved her hand backwards quickly (a couple
drinks later) and "accidentally" slapped someone's butt.  The guy turned around
wondering what happened.  Ramya pretended it didn't happen and didn't look at
him, but Bach said, "sorry my friend just touched your butt, she thinks you're
cute."  Ramya says she got death stares from the man's girlfriend... who was
none other than backwards shirt girl.

Ramya met up with her cousin Suma while at the bar.  Suma gave us good
recommendations for other places to visit while in Chicago.  One of them was
[The Weiners Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wieners_Circle).

---

Next stop was right downstairs, at [Shake
Shack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Shack).  I ordered the ShackBurger
(cheeseburger) and fries.  It was pretty good, but I think I prefer In-n-Out
like a true Californian should.  Bach and Kenny got [Chicago
hotdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_hot_dog) and liked them so
much that they ordered a 3rd to share.  Ramya got a mushroom burger and was
very pleased that it "popped" as she ate it.  Scott tried the SmokeShack.

We threw away our leftovers from breakfast, after carrying them around all day
but never eating them.

---

Next, we headed to [Three Dots and
a Dash](https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago), a tiki bar
recommended to us by many people.  Bach was very unhappy to go to a tiki bar
and tried to distract us with alternative destinations for most of the walk.

![River at night]({% include smart-url
url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0516.jpg' %})

Kenny grabbed a woman who was walking by in what seemed to be a hurry to ask
for a photo.  She was actually very happy to take it.  Later we heard that all
Chicagans are nice when the weather is nice (so a couple weeks a year).

![Us by the river at night]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/kenny/IMG_2456.jpg' %})

We also found some statues that needed to be photographed.

![Standing with some statues]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/ramya/20180524_222036.jpg' %})

Along our walk we saw a bar playing the last 5 minutes of the Warriors
/ Rockets Game 5.  In the last minute the Warriors were behind 2-3 points, so
it was quite exciting to watch with a crowd.

![Inside Three Dots and a Dash]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0517.jpg' %})

At Three Dots and a Dash, we tried to order something called the "head hunter"
which comes with fire on top of it.  However, the waitress persuaded us to buy
a bigger, more expensive drink called the "bali bali," which comes with smoke
and is more theatrical.  It's a big drink meant to be shared.

![Shared drink with dry ice]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0519.jpg' %})

Bach admitted that he was actually having a great time at the tiki bar.
I think he is used to under committed tiki bars, whereas this tiki bar had
really good production quality.  Also, Bach liked that he could take a "boomie"
of the smoke drink.  Apparently, that's what Canadians call boomerangs.  Despite
all that, Bach couldn't keep his eyes open.  In fact, a waiter came over to ask 
if Bach was okay.

![Bach fell asleep]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0523.jpg' %})

Next, we ordered individual drinks.  I got the "three dots and a dash," the
drink for which the bar is named.  It comes with some fruit (which was the best
part).

Later at the Airbnb we played some drinking games.  One of was Ramya's
favorite (before this night when things went badly for her): rage cage.  Bach
also won a bet because he was able to do 10 pushups (despite having an injured
leg)!
