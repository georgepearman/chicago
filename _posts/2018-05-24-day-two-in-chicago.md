We started the morning watching [The
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)), while
waiting for everyone to wake up in the Airbnb.  Ramya is watching the show for
the first time and was watching the beginning of season 3.

Next, we headed to [Wildberry Pancakes and
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2).  This
breakfast spot is right next to [Cloud
Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) (referred to as "the bean" from
now on), but we didn't see the bean afterwards!

I got a [chilaquiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilaquiles) skillet, which
was pretty tasty.

Kenny got some sort of eggs benedict.

However, neither compared to this berry french toast.

We ordered way too much food and coundln't finish it.   We got doggies bags and
ended up carrying leftovers around all day.

After breakfast we were burning up in the sun, so we headed north to find
sunscreen.  Along the way we passed a place called [Nutella
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/nutella-cafe-chicago-3).  Bach and Ramya were
craving nutella for the rest of the trip.

We purchased sunscreen at a nearby CVS and continued north to the [Chicago
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River).  We more or less walked
towards [Trump
Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago))
from the breakfast place.

It was a hot sunny day and the water in the Chicago River looked extremely
inviting.  Once we were close to the river, we noticed that we could go down
some stairs and actually walk along the bank.

There were lots of boats out.

After our boat ride we walked towards a rooftop lounge called
[Cindy's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cindys-chicago), taking the scenic route.
Along the way we saw a [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_(Chicago)).

- Bach did 10 push-ups despite all odds

The view was amazing at Cindy's, but it looked even better with a Friesling in
the shot.

- Ramya slapped someone’s but

- Saw Ramya’s cousin Suma

Next stop was right downstairs, at [Shake
Shack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Shack).  I ordered the ShackBurger
(cheeseburge) and fries.  It was pretty good, but I think I prefer In-n-Out
like a true Californian should.  Bach and Kenny got [Chicago
hotdogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_hot_dog) and liked them so
much that they ordered a 3rd to share.  Ramya got a mushroom burger and was
very pleased that it "popped" as she ate it.  Scott tried the SmokeShack.

---

Next we headed to [Three Dots and
a Dash](https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago), a tiki bar
recommended to us by many people.  Bach was very unhappy to go to a tiki bar
and tried to distract us with alternative destinations for most of the walk.

![River at night]({% include smart-url
url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0516.jpg' %})

Kenny grabbed a woman walking by in what seemed to be a hurry to ask for
a photo.  She was very happy to take it.  Later we heard that all Chicagans are
nice when the weather is nice (so a couple weeks a year).

We also found some statues that needed to be photographed.

Along our walk we saw a bar playing the last 5 minutes of the Warriors
/ Rockets game 5.  The last minute the Warriors were behind 2-3 points so it
was quite exciting to watch with a crowd.

We tried to order something called the "head hunter" which comes with fire on
top of it.  However, the waitress persuaded us to buy a bigger, more expensive
drink called the "bali bali," which comes with smoke and is more theatrical.
Its a big drink meant to be shared.

![Shared drink with dry ice]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0519.jpg' %})

Bach admitted that he was actually having a great time at the tiki bar.
I think he is used to undercommitted tiki bars, whereas this tiki bar had
really good production quality.  Also, Bach liked that he could take a "boomie"
of the smoke drink.  Apparently that's what Canadians call boomerangs.  Despite
all that, Bach couldn't keep his eyes open.  In fact, a waiter came over to ask 
if Bach was okay.

![Bach fell asleep]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may24/george/IMG_0523.jpg' %})

Next we ordered individual drinks.  I got the "three dots and a dash", the
drink for which the bar is named.  It comes with some fruit (which was the best
part).

Later at the Airbnb we played some drinking games.  One of was Ramya's
favorite (before this night): rage cage.   Bach was able to do 10 pushups to
our surprise.
