We started the morning watching [The
Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)), while
waiting for everyone to wake up in the Airbnb.  Ramya is watching the show for
the first time and was watching the beginning of season 3.

Next, we headed to [Wildberry Pancakes and
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wildberry-pancakes-and-cafe-chicago-2).  This
breakfast spot is right next to [Cloud
Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) (referred to as "the bean" from
now on), but we didn't see the bean afterwards!

I got a [chilaquiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilaquiles) skillet, which
was pretty tasty.

Kenny got some sort of eggs benedict.

However, neither compared to this berry french toast.

We ordered way too much food and coundln't finish it.   We got doggies bags and
ended up carrying leftovers around all day.

After breakfast we were burning up in the sun, so we headed north to find
sunscreen.  Along the way we passed a place called [Nutella
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/nutella-cafe-chicago-3).  Bach and Ramya were
craving nutella for the rest of the trip.

We purchased sunscreen at a nearby CVS and continued north to the [Chicago
River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River).  We more or less walked
towards [Trump Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)) from the breakfast place.

It was a hot sunny day and the water in the Chicago River looked extremely
inviting.  Once we were close to the river, we noticed that we could go down
some stairs and actually walk along the bank.

There were lots of boats out.

After our boat ride we walked towards a rooftop lounge called
[Cindy's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cindys-chicago), taking the scenic route.
Along the way we saw a [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial_(Chicago)).

The view was amazing at Cindy's, but it looked even better with a Friesling in
the shot.

Later at the Airbnb we played some drinking games.  One of was Ramya's
favorite (before this night): rage cage.
