We had a very lazy morning (watched more Friends).  For lunch we called [The
Art of Pizza](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-art-of-pizza-chicago) and ordered
a deep dish pizza.  The plan was to walk and pick up the pizza to eat while we
got ready for the wedding.  However, once we got to the pizza place we decided
to just eat there.

The pizza was pretty good - better than I expected.  Normally I don't like deep
dish because it's a lot of sauce.  This deep dish pizza was more bread and
cheese with a regular sauce portion.  We got half meat lovers and half
vegetarian.

There was a Jewel Osco nearby, so we stopped there on the way home to purchase
some more beer.

Back home we preprared for the wedding.  Here is me in my suit with beer pong
in the background.

While waiting for the wedding to start, we signed a photo and a basketball for
Paul.  They had boba for the guests to drink!  The actual boba in the drink was
not good - Paul told us later that this was the catering company's first time
making boba.

Here's where the ceremony was going to take place.

This is our row.  We sat on the right side and are still not sure if that's the
bride's or the groom's side.  The wedding was quite small - maybe 50 people
total.

Paul looked extremely happy the entire wedding day.

The person performing the ceremony was someone Paul met while running in
Chicago.  He became licensed to marry people just for this wedding.  While
giving a speech during the ceremony he told us that Paul used to talk about
Britta while they trained for marathons.  It started short at first - just for
a few miles.  Later, Paul would talk about Britta for 5-6 miles!  Then 10+!

The ceremony itself was very short.  I think the whole thing lasted maybe 20 or
25 minutes.  Paul and Britta were crying most of the time.  When it was Paul's
turn to give his vows, he started by saying, "Sorry everyone, I have really bad
allergies today."

The wedding was hosted at the [Peggy Notebaert Nature
Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Notebaert_Nature_Museum), and after
the ceremony the guests could walk around the exhibits.  The most popular one
was a room filled with butterflies.

We were able to see Paul and Britta doing a photoshoot from across the museum.

At 7:30 PM all the guests reconvened in a dining area for dinner.  The LinkedIn
crew sat at table 11.

I knew the wedding color was pink and Brad had a pink tie I could borrow.
Turns out the two pinks were very similar - it's like I was part of the bridal
party!

When Paul and Britta walked in, the first thing they did was cut the wedding
cake.  After that, Paul gave a speech.  Paul started by thanking everyone for
attending, and thanked coworkers for coming before thanking friends or
family!  He also mentioned people from California and Canada in the speech - 
Bach was very roudy.

I photographed the food for dinner.  We all started with a salad:

I ordered the salmon for my main course.

Here is Bach's pork dish:

Ramya got the vegetarian option - beet risotto I think.

There were many choices for dessert, but the wedding cake was the most
delicious.

All throughout dinner Bach, Ramya, and I were watching a Warriors basketball
game (semi-finals game 6).  They ended up winning, so it was definitely worth
it!

After dinner it turned into a dance party.  We also transitioned from drinking
wine to drinking cranberry juice with vodka.

We managed to get some time with Paul and Britta as they were doing the rounds.

Here is Sang and Gloria.

Whenever possible, the DJ tried to get the bride and groom dancing in the
middle of the floor.  Thinking more, everyone at the wedding seemed to be
trying to get Paul and Britta to dance the whole time.

At the end of the night the DJ asked everyone to do a group hug around Paul and
Britta.

Paul gave one last speech.  At the end I cheered for Britta to give a speech
too, but no one else seemed into that.  Other people were telling Paul "happy
birthday."  Apparently his friends from Canada always tell people it's his
birthday wherever they go.

We snagged one more picture as we were leaving.

The wedding ended around 12 PM and we Ubered to the [Weiners
Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wieners_Circle) (again).  Bach,
Kenny, and Scott went to pee in an alleyway.  Ramya also really had to go, but
couldn't find a bathroom.  We ate another hot dog and called an Uber back to
the Airbnb.  Ramya was unhappy with how slow the Uber driver was.

Back at the Airbnb we finished the night watching more Friends.
