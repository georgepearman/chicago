For lunch we went to the [Chicago Diplomat
Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicago-diplomat-cafe-chicago), which was about
5 minutes walking distance from our Airbnb.  The waitress was a very good
saleswoman, so we ended up ordering more food than we had planned.  The best
thing we ordered was this vegetarian dish called "ajapsandali" which means
something like "mess" in Georgian.

This cheese bread tasted like banana pizza.

The mushrooms were also a big hit.

We ordered a bottle of what we thought was lemonade.  Turns out it comes in
many different flavors.  The one we ordered tasted like licorice.

I was excited about these dumplings, but they didn't end up being too good.
There was a lot of dough.

Chicken and potatoes is a classic dish in every culture it seems.

Next, we walked towards [Wrigley
Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field).  Along the way we stopped
at [Jeni's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeni%27s_Splendid_Ice_Creams) for
some ice cream.  Only Bach ordered something because we were so full.

Once at Wrigley Field we took some photos, then promptly ordered an Uber.  It
was quite crowded because there was a game about to start.  It was Cubs vs
Giants - if we had realized ahead of time who was playing, we might have
watched it!

Next stop was the [John Hancock
Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/875_North_Michigan_Avenue) where we went
up 96 floors to the [Signature
Lounge](https://www.yelp.com/biz/signature-lounge-chicago-2).

![John Hancock Center from the bottom]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may27/george/IMG_0655.jpg' %})

We had received many recommendations for the view at the top.  There are quite
a few buildings in Chicago that allow you to pay to go to the top floor.  This
lounge is free, however, as long as you buy a drink; and it has a great view.

We sat for about an hour at the top of the building.  While there we played
"heads up."

This is my drink - a "dragon berry lychee mojito."  It was delicious.

For dinner we went to [Seoul
Taco](https://www.yelp.com/biz/seoul-taco-chicago-2) based on Paul's
recommendation.  This place serves Korean fusion food and was really good!
I definitely would want to go back here when I visit Chicago next.

While there, Bach got called "Batch" by the waiter.

[The Second City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_City) is a famous
improvisational comedy club and we wanted to catch a show while in Chicago.
The one we picked was called "Hopscotch."  The venue was called "The Backout
Cabaret" (sorry for the blurry picture) and was a small room that seated around
30 people.

![Blurry picture of The Blackout Cabaret]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may27/george/IMG_0657.jpg' %})

We got really good seats (it was first come first serve) in the second row.

![All of us inside the show]({% include smart-url url='/assets/img/may27/kenny/IMG_2688.jpg' %})

I don't think any of us really liked the show.  It wasn't too funny but the
actors thought they were being hilarious.  I guess it's hit or miss for improv
shows.  Outside the theater we all made each other laugh way more than during
the show - maybe we should do improv instead.

Our next Uber had really good music and led lights all over the ceiling.  When
we were driving on the freeway a driver next to us was waving and thought the
van was really awesome (it was).  The good music got us in the mood for our
next destination - karaoke in China Town.

The karaoke place was really fun.  We reserved a private room for two hours,
but were having so much fun that we stayed for a third.  Ramya and Bach are
really good at singing.

After getting kicked out of our room, we played dice at a table in the common
area.

We couldn't decide if China Town was safe to roam about at 2 AM, so we took
a few photos and left.

Back at the Airbnb we watched Friends one last time.
