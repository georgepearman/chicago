We planned to arrive at the airport at 1 PM for our 2:20 PM flight.  The five
of us took the entire day off work.  By around 11:00 AM I was quite bored, so
Kenny and I decided to meet at the airport sooner - we ended up getting through
security around 12:30 PM.  Kenny has a priority pass so we were able to enter
[The Club](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-club-at-sjc-san-jose) for free!  While
there we enjoyed a buffet and unlimited drinks.

On the plane we decided to keep drinking, and started with some wine tasting.

The flight attendant collected our trash, but Ramya wanted her bottle because
it was so cute.  Kenny talked to the flight attendant and was able to get the
bottle back.  About 5 minutes later the flight attendant came back with a free
wine for Ramya, saying if she is going to keep it, she should have a full one!

After all that drinking we needed to use the bathroom.  Ramya decided that she
is first class, however, and said she would go up front.  Kenny strongly
advised against it because he has had bad experiences in the past where he got
told to go use the peasant bathroom instead.

So, Ramya and Kenny decided to bet 1 drink.  If Ramya could successfully use
the special bathroom Kenny would buy her a drink (and vice-versa).  Ramya won,
but Kenny never paid up.

Here is Ramya's free wine from the flight attendent and our next round:

Feeling very jolly, we decided it was time for a photoshoot.  First, here is
row 27 (left to right: George, Ramya, Kenny, Bach):

We dared Bach to take a selfie from a greater distance and he happily obliged.
Kenny could not stop laughing in these photos because he was looking at the
phone screen as Bach took the photo and found the lady in front of him very
entertaining.

The view outside our window was not too great during the flight.

As we were leaving the plane, Bach mentioned that a baby looks like
[Mantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_(Marvel_Comics)).  The father
overheard him and said "yeah, I wish she had super powers."

We arrived 9 PM Chicago time (11 PM Pacific) very hungry.  We headed straight
for the Airbnb to drop off our luggage.  Kenny was very excited to see the
"brick exposed walls" in the rental apartment.

After dropping our bags, we Ubered to a restaurant called
[Little Bad Wolf](https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-bad-wolf-chicago).  I ordered
a burger, which was delicious (you can also see Bach's chicken and mashed
potatoes in the background).

After dinner we went shopping at a nearby
[Jewel-Osco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_(supermarket)) (popular
supermarket in Chicago that we had never heard of before).  We bought sandwich
supplies, omelette ingredients, and some snacks.  We noticed that the liquor
was chained off, so we tried to buy beer which was in the public area.  However
we were yelled at over the loud speaker.  Apparently this chain does not serve
alcohol after 10 PM.

So, Kenny and Bach Ubered to a liquor store they found online that was
supposedly open.  During their Uber trip they saw a 24 hour CVS, so hopped out to
buy alcohol there.

Back at the Airbnb I went to sleep because I was exhausted.  The other four
stayed up to hang out.  Two hours later I woke up and they were still up, so
I joined them for some card games.  Around 4 AM we decided to sleep, and Ramya
noticed that she got a noise complaint 2 hours earlier.
